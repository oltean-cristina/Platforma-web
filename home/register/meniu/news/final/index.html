          Girls and boys, children with disabilities, those from minority groups and children living in poor and remote
          areas are most
          often denied access to education. This has far-reaching consequences on their futures and those of their
          families,
          communities and countries.
          Every child has the right to access safe, quality education!

          We are humans who want the same thing as every other human wants â€” a safe place to live on this planet we call
          home. So
          while our work must continue to be unbiased and objective, increasingly we are raising our voices, adding to
          the clear
          message that climate change is real and humans are responsible, the impacts are serious and we must act now.

          By conserving wildlife, we're ensuring that future generations can enjoy our natural world and the incredible

          that live within it. To help protect wildlife, it's important to understand how species interact within their
          ecosystems, and how they're affected by environmental and human influences.

            It was and still is a very difficult period. We were called to work and we stayed there for even 48 hours in
            a row, trying to save as many
            lives as possible. There were many times when we had to make radical decisions that could change the lives
            of the people we treated. We just hope
            that everyone stays safe and are protecting themself in the best possible way.
